# Sparse regularization via bidualization

This project is for the course [HMMA307 by Joseph Salmon](http://josephsalmon.eu/HMMA307.html).

The goal is here to understand the theory and then reproduce some of the results from the article by Amir Beck and Yehonathan Refael available [at this adress](https://www.tau.ac.il/~becka/bidual.pdf).

In short, it deals with an efficient way to compute the sparse envelope function for a new penalty that takes into account the sparsity of a vector using the 0-norm. It appears in several problems as regularizing a function has become usual and is more accurate than the elastic net in certain situations.
