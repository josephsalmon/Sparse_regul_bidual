# Sparse regularization via bidualization

This project is for the course [HMMA307 by Joseph Salmon](http://josephsalmon.eu/HMMA307.html).

The goal is here to understand the theory and then reproduce some of the results from the article by Amir Beck and Yehonathan Refael available [at this adress](https://www.tau.ac.il/~becka/bidual.pdf).

In short, it deals with an efficient way to compute the sparse envelope function. It appears in several problems as regularizing a function has become usual.

On a side note, the theory behind this method uses techniques from the course: in particular the main result is based on convex-optimization.
